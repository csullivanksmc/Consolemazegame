# Console Maze Game

This was a little activity I made for myself after learning some of the basics of how to write code in Csharp. My objective was to use some
OOP concepts as well as the applicable syntax which I had learned for things like iterative loops, variable decleration etc. While the game is simple,
and currently doesnt actually even have a win condition, I found it a great way to engage the new information I had just learned. Furthermore,
I was able to be creative in my approach to how the program achieves its goal (allowing the player to move a character through a maze on the console) 
with what metrics to evaluate not just how to envoke that in the code.
